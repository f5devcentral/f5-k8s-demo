Lab â€“ Build a NGINX+ Container [OPTIONAL]
=========================================

When deploying NGINX+ in a Kubernetes cluster you will need to build a local
container that has NGINX+.

The following is an optional lab exercise.  We have pre-built an image for your
use in the lab environment and made the necessary modifications to pull from
the pre-built repository.

Retrieve NGINX License Cert/Key
-------------------------------

On the K8S Cluster in the directory ``~/kubernetes-ingress`` you will need to 
place a copy of ``nginx-repo.crt`` and ``nginx-repo.key`` that you obtain from
the NGINX Customer portal.

Build an image and push to a private repo
-----------------------------------------

The following resource should be used when pushing to a private repo:

https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/master/build

In the UDF demo environment the address of the internal registry is
``registry.internal:30500`` and the user credentials are "registry:registry".
